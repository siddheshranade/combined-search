# Combined Search

The website is live at: https://combinedsearch.io.

It requires no setup or prior knowledge to use. All you need to do to use this is allow pop-ups on your browser.

If you're constantly looking up stuff on Wikipedia, Reddit, YouTube, etc. (like me), you can now do so from a single place instead of manually opening ten different tabs. I made this because I wanted to make casual web browsing a bit more convenient. 

Contributions, bug reports, and improvements are welcome.
